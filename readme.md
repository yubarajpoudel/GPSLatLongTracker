##Description
This is the simple android application that fetch the latitude and longitude from the mobile GPS if location is avaialable and from network if GPS is off.
Apart from that it will save the latitude and longitude offline if network not connected and sync to server when network connection is on. Also the service will automatically
get on when the GPS is turned or or off and start to sync. Since all the work is done in service the app will work no matter the app is in foreground or not.

Thanks.
